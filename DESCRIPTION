Description: ColOpenData is a package that acquires, standardizes, and wrangles Colombian
    socioeconomic, climate and land cover data. It solves the problem of
    Colombian data being issued in different web pages and formats by using functions that
    allow the user to select the desired database and download it without having to do the
    exhausting acquisition process. Also, it allows these datasets to be merged so multiple
    operations, such as calculating statistics, can be made, taking into account information
    from different datasets.
