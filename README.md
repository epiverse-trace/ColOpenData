ColOpenData is a package that acquires, standardizes, and wrangles
Colombian socioeconomic, climate and land cover data. It solves the
problem of Colombian data being issued in different web pages and
formats by using functions that allow the user to select the desired
database and download it without having to do the exhausting acquisition
process. Also, it allows these datasets to be merged so multiple
operations, such as calculating statistics, can be made, taking into
account information from different datasets.

<!-- This sentence is optional and can be removed -->

ColOpenData is developed at [Universidad de Los
Andes](https://uniandes.edu.co/) as part of the [Epiverse-TRACE
program](https://data.org/initiatives/epiverse/).

## Installation

You can install the development version of ColOpenData from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("epiverse-trace/ColOpenData")
```

## Quick start

This example shows how to retrieve census data at a department level in
Colombia including the administrative divisions and spatial data and use
it to visualize Dengue cases in a specific region. We will first load
the needed extra packages.

``` r
library(ColOpenData)
library(sf)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(RColorBrewer)
```

We will be using the `MGNCNPV_DPTO_2018` dataset, that contains the
National Geo statistical Framework (MGN) and the National Population and
Living Census (CNPV) at department level for 2018.

To download the dataset we can use the `download` function as follows

``` r
census <- download("MGNCNPV_DPTO_2018")
```

Once downloaded, we can filter the data to subset only the region of
interest using the `filter_mgn_cnpv` function. We will be selecting the
departments in the southern regions of Colombia (Amazonia and
Orinoquia), using the [DIVIPOLA
codes](https://www.datos.gov.co/widgets/gdxc-w37w) of each department,
and extract only the names, populations and geometries.

``` r
south_col <- census %>%
  filter_mgn_cnpv(
    codes = c(91, 18, 19, 94, 95, 50, 52, 86, 97, 99, 81, 85),
    columns = c("DPTO_CNMBR", "STP27_PERS"),
    include_geometry = TRUE
  )
```

For the Dengue case count of 2018 we will use the lodaded dataset
`dengue_2018`, which was previously obtained using the package
[sivirep](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/sivirep/).

``` r
data(dengue_2018)
str(dengue_2018)
#> tibble [34 Ã— 2] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)
#>  $ DPTO_CCDGO: chr [1:34] "00" "01" "05" "08" ...
#>  $ CASES     : int [1:34] 4 407 3737 3298 1395 96 47 191 177 2103 ...
```

To merge the datasets we will use the DIVIPOLA codes.

``` r
dengue_south <- merge(x = south_col, 
                         y = dengue_2018, 
                         by = "DPTO_CCDGO")
```

Finally, we can plot the data

``` r
ggplot(data = dengue_south) +
  geom_sf(mapping = aes(fill = CASES)) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(
    colours = brewer.pal(7, "YlOrRd"),
    name = element_blank()
  ) +
  ggtitle("Dengue Cases in the Southern Region of Colombia") +
  theme_bw()
```

### Lifecycle

This package is currently a *concept*, as defined by the [RECON software
lifecycle](https://www.reconverse.org/lifecycle.html). This means that
essential features and mechanisms are still being developed, and the
package is not ready for use outside of the development team.
