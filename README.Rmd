**ColOpenData** is a package that acquires and wrangles
Colombian socioeconomic, geospatial and climate data. It solves the
problem of Colombian data being issued in different web pages and sources
by using functions that allow the user to select the desired
dataset and download it without having to do the exhausting acquisition
process.

ColOpenData is developed at [Universidad de Los
Andes](https://uniandes.edu.co/) as part of the [Epiverse-TRACE
program](https://data.org/initiatives/epiverse/).

## Installation

You can install the development version of ColOpenData from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("epiverse-trace/ColOpenData")
```
## Quick Overview

**ColOpenData** contains data from two public data sources: The National 
Administrative Department of Statistics 
[(DANE)](https://www.dane.gov.co/index.php/en/), and the Institute of Hydrology,
Meteorology and Environmental Studies [(IDEAM)]( http://www.ideam.gov.co/). 
The available data is divided in three categories: 

- **Demographic:** Demographic and Socioeconomic data is taken from the National Population and Dwelling Census (CNPV) of 2018, the most recent census available to date. The information is presented as an answer to three questions: How many are we?, Where are we? and How do we live? Further information can be consulted [here](https://www.dane.gov.co/index.php/estadisticas-por-tema/demografia-y-poblacion/censo-nacional-de-poblacion-y-vivenda-2018).

- **Geospatial:** This data is retrieved from the National Geostatistical Framework (MGN), which includes maps and a summarized version of the 2018 census, aggregated to spatial geometries. The data is available at different aggregation levels including: Blocks, Urban and Rural Sections, Urban and Rural Sectors, Urban Areas, Municipalities and Departments. More information is available [here](https://www.dane.gov.co/index.php/actualidad-dane/5454-el-dane-actualizo-el-marco-geoestadistico-nacional-a-2018).

- **Climate:** Climate data is recovered from backup information provided by IDEAM, containing historical data from the first station in the country until May 31st 2023. This backup includes temperature, precipitation, sunshine duration, wind direction, among others. More information can be found [here](http://www.ideam.gov.co/).

Documentation and vignettes are available for the three modules in the [user vignettes](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/ColOpenData/).

### Lifecycle

This package is currently a *concept*, as defined by the [RECON software
lifecycle](https://www.reconverse.org/lifecycle.html). This means that
essential features and mechanisms are still being developed, and the
package is not ready for use outside of the development team.
